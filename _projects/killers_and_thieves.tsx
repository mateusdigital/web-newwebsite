            Following my contributions to Stoic Studio's <Link href="./the_banner_saga">The Banner Saga</Link>,
            I received an invitation to join the team working on Killers and Thieves, a game they were
            preparing to publish at the time.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was responsible for enhancing and finalizing the game for publication by adding new
            features, rectifying bugs, and conducting significant optimization work on the <b>Lua</b> and <b>Unity</b> interop code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, I undertook the integration of the <b>Steamworks API</b> and refined AI algorithms for in-game heists.
