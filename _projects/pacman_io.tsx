            Pacman.io is an online multiplayer game based on the classic arcade game Pac-Man.
            Players control their own Pac-Man character and compete against others in real-time.

            I've worked both in the client using <b>Emscripten</b>, and the server side, implement features
            and optimizations until the release of the game. The most notable one was some improvements to rendering routines, gaining ~36% (~30fps -&gt; ~41fps).</p>
