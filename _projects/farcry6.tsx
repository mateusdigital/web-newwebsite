            After contributing to the development of '<Link href="./skull_and_bones">Skull and Bones</Link>'
            I moved to the Far Cry 6 team to aid the release of the '<b>LOST BETWEEN WORLDS'</b> DLC.
          </p>

          <p>
            My primary responsibilities involved addressing bugs within <b>A11Y</b> components,
            ensuring accessibility standards were met.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this project, I had the opportunity to collaborate
            with <b>Dunia</b> engine and <b>Phoenix UI</b> framework.
