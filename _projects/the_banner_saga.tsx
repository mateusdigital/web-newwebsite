            Firehorse and Stoic Studio had the same publisher at the time - VersusEvil, which
            allowed them to collaborate very interestingly and I ended up working with
            those amazing award-winning games.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was responsible to maintain and improve both games for Stoic Studio.
            At the time it was a huge challenge since the games were written in a totally
            different stack that I was used to. Also the scope of the project - then, the
            biggest project I had worked on - made it a true challenge.
          </p>

          <p>
            The game was written in a mixture of languages with Action Script 3 as the primally
            language for the game and tools, and lots of different middleware for multiple
            platforms. Ant was used as the build system, and Mercurial was the versioning
            used by the team.
          </p>

          <p>
            While I engaged in a couple of meetings with the Stoic team, most of my work
            centered around selecting tasks from Jira and collaborating with
            fellow developers to address any arising issues.

          This is one of the most beloved projects that I've worked on, it helped to open
          so many doors and gave me so nice opportunities.
          After this project, I got the opportunity to make Stoic Studio's <Link href="/projects/killers_and_thieves">Killers and Thieves</Link>.
