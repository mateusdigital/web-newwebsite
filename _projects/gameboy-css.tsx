            I thought that would be great to have a Gameboy
            frame for the <Link href="https://mateus.digital/el_jamon_volador">El Jamon Volador</Link> page,
            and I saw it as opportunity to start to get into making art with CSS.

            This is my very-first project and I'm very happy with it :)

        </section>
      </DemoPage_>
